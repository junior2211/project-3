    not!) and you’re responsible for throwing a party! The smartest  <br> way to throw a low maintenance, high fun gathering? Take
    it outside. To the pool more specifically. It gets everyone out  <br> of the house (so no pre-party cleaning) and you’ve got a
    built-in activity that will keep adults and kids busy for hours. <br>  Plus, since you’re already outside, it makes perfect
    sense to fire up the grill and put out a few make-ahead salads   <br>  and apps. This is one type of party that’s a breeze to
    host.</em></p><br>
